ing delete# Recipe Book App in SwiftUI

---

## Background 
This project is designed to enrich and enhance the recipe exploration, recipe creation, and recipe organization processes within a mobile application format. 
Traditionally, an individual might have dozens of recipe books and finding a particular recipe can be time consuming at the least and straight up exhausting at worst.

This iOS application is designed to help address some of these common issues that are encountered by everyday home cooks.

## Design
This project was designed with SwiftUI and Firebase


## My Experience
It was a simple yet fulfilling process that showed the basics of the library and interacting with live data. 

I am glad this was one of my first projects that I created for myself with SwiftUI and Firebase.

##  What I would change
* Would likely move to a SQL based database rather than noSQL due to interesting interactions of models and many cases where cascading deletes are advantageous
* Developing out a UI in Figma and testing with users would be desirable
* Enabling universal grocery lists (combines all lists at once)
* Allowing users to enter in their current stock of ingredients as desired

## API Keys

Running this project locally, would require a GoogleService-Info.plist file from your Firebase console https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup
